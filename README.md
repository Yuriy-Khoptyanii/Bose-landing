# Bose layout
In this task, I implement the landing according to the model from Figma - https://www.figma.com/file/OMjQNb3hg1LKMV4OwyQ3Ao/BOSE?node-id=0%3A1

I made 3 versions of the display layout - mobile, tablet, desktop.

This example is made to demonstrate the ability to reproduce a layout design.
